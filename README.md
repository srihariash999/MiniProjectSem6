Mini project files for Semester 6


The aim of the project is to create a stand-alone MQTT based chat- terminal. It is basically sending and recieving messages currently using free mqtt broker @ broker.mqtt-dashboard.com.

It also has an LCD and a T9 style keypad interfaced to it to type and display the text.

The to-and-fro chat is tested using mosquitto client, MQTT box and My MQTT android app. So far so good !
